Standalone (pseudo) Random number generation Library.

The library is designed for "statistically" random values,
suitable for scientific use (e.g., simulation).
No effort is made for "security" (i.e., looking at the past
history of values, can we predict the next one).

The algorithm used is currently based on an algorithm from
"Improved Long-Period Generators Based on Linear Recurrences Modulo 2"
by F. Panneton, P. L'Ecuyer, and M. Matsumoto,
ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software, 32 (1), pp 1-16, 2006.

Contents of the directories:

include/    Header files, for compiling applications.
src/        Implementation of the required functions.
lib/        Compiled library.
            (Do we need/want to split this by architecture?)
examples/   Example and test applications.
doxy/       Documentation of front-end
            (generated by doxygen)

You should be able to build the library by simply typing "make" 
in the main directory.
