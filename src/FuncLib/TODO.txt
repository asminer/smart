To do list for builtin function module:

*  Should we allow users to pick and choose
   which functions they want in the symbol table?
   Or, which classes of functions?

*  Need a way to link the function "exit"
   to other behaviors, like the old "smart_exit".

   Should we move "io_environ" to a more generic
   "environ" class, outside of the stream module,
   that behaves a lot like the old io_environ but
   includes special things like "exit"?
