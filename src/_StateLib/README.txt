Standalone state storage library.

Right now, this is an experiment.  Can it be done efficiently as
a separate library?

A "state" is a (variable-length) array of integers.

include/    Header files, for compiling applications.
src/        Implementation of the required functions.
lib/        Compiled library.
examples/   Example and test applications.
doxy/       Documentation for front-end
            (generated by doxygen)

You should be able to build the library by simply typing "make" 
and then "make install" in the main directory.
