TO DO LIST:


Slight "ProcessGeneration" reorganization

  * MeddlyStateGeneration should be MeddlyProcessGeneration

  * convert saturation, etc. to same style as explicit, i.e.,
    same algorithm with parameter for "states only" or not

  * then add "EXPLICIT" MeddlyProcessGeneration algorithm :^)


CTL / stateset reorganization

  * stateset class becomes abstract with a hierarchy?

      + explicit -> bitvector

      + symbolic -> meddly-based, leave room for others?

  * revisit CTL engine mechanism?
