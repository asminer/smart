README file for "Modules".

These are intended as add-on modules for types and other basic language
features, with minimalist interface.  Similarly, any (thin) wrappers
around external libraries should go here.

Solution engine modules, and formalism modules, belong elsewhere
(because there can potentially be many, so they are grouped together).
