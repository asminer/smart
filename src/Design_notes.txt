SMART VERSION 2 "Grand Library Yank"
External (stand alone) libraries:

    RNG
    Linear solvers
    Sparse vectors
    State storage (explicit)
    Markov chains (explicit)
    Semi-Markov processes?  (handle "immediate" transitions)
    Finite state machines?  (with CTL stuff)
    Simulation?
    MDD library


------------------------------------------------------------
Internal Smart "libraries" (or "modules"):

    Expressions & Statements
      * use hooks for model solution engines
        e.g., RegisterEngine(engtype, function)

      * use hooks for non-basic operators
        e.g., addition of phase-types
        use function (registered?) to build expression

    Parser (symbol tables, syntax)

    (separate or together:)
    State space generation engine
    Reach graph generation engine
    MC generation engine

    I/O and documentation formatting

    Options?

    Model checking engine?

    Simulation?


------------------------------------------------------------
State space options:

  * Potential    State space is the cross-product
        of all possible values for each
        state variable.  Note that this is
        used for Markov chains, where there
        is only one "enumerated" state var.
        And, of course, we need to know the
        possible values for each variable.

  * Potential with constraints?
        Like above, but we give a boolean
        expression that tells if a given state
        is present or not.
        Can we merge with Potential efficiently?

  * Explicit    

  * MDD
