Instructions to build 

0.  autoreconf --install

    This step is necessary for the first build, and anytime some
    configure.ac or Makefile.am changes.


1.  ./configure

    System specific configuration.  See "Configuration Options"
    below for useful arguments to pass to this script.


2.  make

    Builds everything


3.  make check

    Runs tests (there are a few)


4.  make install



Configuration Options
---------------------

  --prefix=INSTALL_DIR      Default is in this directory

  --without-pnfront         Don't try to link the PNFront library for examples
                            that use it; will produce some useless executables.

  --with-pnfront-path=/path Specify the path of the PNFront library.

  CXXFLAGS="<options>"      For passing arguments to the C++ compiler.
                            Useful arguments include "-O3" and "-Wall"
