                        Each entry is a string where
                        str[j] tells how this event affects variable j:
                        '+' means the event increases the variable by one
                            (unless this would violate the bound)
                        '-' means the event decreases the variable by one
                            (unless the value is already zero)
                        '.' means no change.
      @param  nEvents   Size of events array.
      @param  f   The forest to use; should be a boolean one for relations.
      @param  e   Edge to store the result.
