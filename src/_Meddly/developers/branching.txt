Preferred mechanism for Meddly feature additions: branching.


MAKE A BRANCH:

(0) Create a local branch and switch to it

    $ git checkout -b my_branch


(1) Optionally, share that branch with the server:

    $ git push origin my_branch


MERGE A BRANCH BACK:

(0) Commit desired changes into the branch.

(1) Switch back to master branch.

    $ git checkout master

(2) Make sure you have the latest code from the server

    $ git pull

    Or do a git fetch followed by git merge.

(3) Merge your branch into the master

    $ git merge my_branch

(4) Build and test; resolve any issues

(5) Commit changes 

(6) Delete the branch when you're done with it:

    $ git branch -d my_branch             (local branch)

    $ git push origin --delete my_branch  (remote branch)
