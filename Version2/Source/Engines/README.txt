Smart version 2, "Engines" module.

Basically, numerical solution algorithms and simulation stuff is all here.

Files, and what they define

File	  	What's there
----------	----------------------------------------------------
api		Front end

sccs		Determines sccs of graphs (explicitly)

linear		Solves linear systems.

numerical	Solves measures by analyzing the underlying process.
		E.g., generate and solve a Markov chain

simul		Discrete-event simulation engines.

ssgen		State space generation (explicit and eventually...)
