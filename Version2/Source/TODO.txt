Things to do:

* Proper display of MCs in num_arcs

* Weight classes

* MC generation algorithm to eliminate vanishing "on the fly"

* SS + MC generation algorithm to eliminate vanishing "on the fly"

* Add "Embedded DTMC" generation algorithm?

* phase types as models (see notes)

* Help "topics"

* Add Lexical ordering for display only in num_states, num_arcs

* FSM formalism

* Explicit model checking
