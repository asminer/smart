Things to do:

* MC generation algorithm to eliminate vanishing "on the fly"

  + Check ss option for vanishing

  + store v-v, v-t graphs separately?

  + get #visits to each vanishing, multiply by v-t

* SS + MC generation algorithm to eliminate vanishing "on the fly"

* Add "Embedded DTMC" generation algorithm?

* phase types as models (see notes)
