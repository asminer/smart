Things to do:

* Check state/MC display for pns, both natural and lexical orderings

* MC generation algorithm to eliminate vanishing "on the fly"

* SS + MC generation algorithm to eliminate vanishing "on the fly"

* Add "Embedded DTMC" generation algorithm?

* phase types as models (see notes)

* Help "topics"

* FSM formalism

* Explicit model checking
