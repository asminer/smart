Currently working on:  

* Just added flatss class (in flatss file)

* Go from "tree" to "flatss" class



Things to do:

* Generic priority structure in state_model class,
  so we don't have to re-implement it for every formalism.

* Consider creating a global "event" type, deriving "transition" from it
  events can 
	+ have firing distributions attached
	+ be visible outside of dsm...

* Models
