Things to check on:

* Memory leaks

* Input functions


Things to do:

* For "state change": consider another type of expression,
  PROC_STATE (or something else?)
  with "signature"
  void StateChange(const state &current, state &next, result &x);
  // x is for catching errors

  Then define "(cross) product of state changes"...

* Move specialized operators into "Formalisms/ops_spn"
  and eliminate "Language/ops_extra"

* Generic priority structure in state_model class,
  so we don't have to re-implement it for every formalism.

* Models
