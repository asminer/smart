Things to check on:

* Memory leaks

* Input functions


Things to do:

* For "state change": consider another type of expression,
  PROC_STATE (or something else?)
  with "signature"
  void StateChange(const state &current, state &next, result &x);
  // x is for catching errors

  Then define "(cross) product of state changes"...

* Make sure we correctly handle things like

  rand real x := ...;
  rand real y := x + x;  // Can't sample x twice!

* Models
