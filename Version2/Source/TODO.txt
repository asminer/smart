Currently working on:  trees for state space storage

Things to check on:

* Memory leaks

* Input functions


Things to do:

* Generic priority structure in state_model class,
  so we don't have to re-implement it for every formalism.

* Consider creating a global "event" type, deriving "transition" from it
  events can 
	+ have firing distributions attached
	+ be visible outside of dsm...

* Add mechanism to track where a model was "instantiated", so, e.g.,
  an error message during state space generation can say so

* Models
