Things to do:

* Notion of immediate events
	(use a shared "const0" expression...)

* Write state generation algorithms that eliminate vanishing "on the fly"
	Use a second state array to hold vanishing states,
	clear them once all vanishing from a tangible have been explored

  + CTMC: do it properly (solve DTMC)

  + cache option: save the vanishing states and their results
    in case we see them again during search?

* phase types as models (see notes)
