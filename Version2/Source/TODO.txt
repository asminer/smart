Things to do:

* zero cost promotions when base type unchanged
	(e.g., INT to RAND INT)
  because computing an INT is the same as sampling it.

  split types out of expressions?
  e.g., add a typed_expr struct = { type t, expr* e };

  or, split modifiers out of expressions
  typed_expr struct = { bool proc, modif m, expr* e };

* Marking-dependent firing rates

* Impulse rewards.

* SS + MC generation algorithms that keep vanishing states & arcs

* Add "Embedded DTMC" generation algorithm?

* phase types as models (see notes)

* Help "topics"

* FSM formalism

* Explicit model checking
