Currently:
	
	Debugging for mc generation

Things to do:

* MC generation algorithm to eliminate vanishing "on the fly"

* SS + MC generation algorithm to eliminate vanishing "on the fly"

* Add "Embedded DTMC" generation algorithm?

* phase types as models (see notes)

* Fix weights and distributions; will need both for discrete case.

* So, we need to detect if a distribution is always zero.

* Weight classes

* Consider changing "spn" to "pn".
