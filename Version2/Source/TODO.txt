Working on new unified expression computation.
Fix lots of operators and such :^(

Things to do:

* non-constant parameters; nail down semantics.

* Marking-dependent firing rates

* Impulse rewards.

* SS + MC generation algorithms that keep vanishing states & arcs

* Add "Embedded DTMC" generation algorithm?

* phase types as models (see notes)

* Help "topics"

* FSM formalism

* Explicit model checking
