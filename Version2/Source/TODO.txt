Things to do:

* Generic priority structure in state_model class,
  so we don't have to re-implement it for every formalism.

  + re-sort events in dsm constructor, to be ordered according
    to priority rules

  + implement "GetEnabledList"

* Petri nets: implement function
	prio ( {trans} : {trans, ...)
	where all transitions in the first set have priority
	over all transitions in the second set.

* Modify state generation algorithms to handle priority
  (should be easy)

* Notion of immediate events
	(use a shared "const0" expression...)

* Write state generation algorithms that eliminate vanishing "on the fly"
	Use a second state array to hold vanishing states,
	clear them once all vanishing from a tangible have been explored

* phase types as models (see notes)
