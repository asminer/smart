Main Smart directory.

Note: ALL of Smart is now divided into modules; each module is built into a
library file and linked together at the end.

Current list of modules:

Base	
	I/O streams, types, options, and timers (stopwatches)

Templates
	Several handy template classes (stacks, lists, etc.)

Language
	Roughly, the basic smart language.  Expressions and statements.

Formalisms
	Front-end formalisms (dtmc, ctmc, spn and such)

Rng
	Random number generation library (currently MT19937)

Main	
	smart lexer and compiler, builtins, and symbol table stuff.

States
	Discrete states and sets of them.
