New autotools version of Smart (since revision 1339)

See the INSTALL file for build instructions.

Note: we have two binary directories, one for development code
(debugging) and one for release.  Binary directories are not
separated out by architecture; hopefully, autotools will help
with porting across systems.  If you absolutely must have different
directories for different architectures (e.g., a common filesystem
for multiple architectures), the easiest thing to do is to check
out multiple copies from the repository, one for each architecture.


Subdirectories and what they are for.
