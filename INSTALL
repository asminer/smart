Instructions to build

0.  autoreconf --install

    This step is necessary for the first build, and anytime
    configure.ac or any Makefile.am changes.

1.  ./Config-devel  &&  ./Config-release

    System-specific configuration.
    You can set environment variables to change the locations
    of the libraries, e.g.,
      
    # env MDD_LIB=/alternate/mdd/location ./Config-devel

2.  cd bin-devel   OR   cd bin-release

3.  make

    This builds everything

4.  make check  OR  make check-old

    Run regression tests.  
    
    make check:       Requires automake version 1.12 or higher.
    make check-old:   Should always work

5.  make bench

    Run timing tests.  More important for release code.

6.  make install

    Copies binaries into bin
    (otherwise they are in src/Apps)
