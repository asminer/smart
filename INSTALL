Instructions to build

0.  autoreconf --force --install

    This step is necessary for the first build, and anytime configure.ac
    or any Makefile.am changes.

1.  ./Config-devel  &&  ./Config-release

    System-specific configuration.  You can set environment variables to
    change the locations of the libraries, e.g.,
      
    # env MDD_LIB=/alternate/mdd/location ./Config-devel

    Any arguments passed to these scripts, are in turn passed on to the
    ./configure script.  Useful arguments:

        --without-gmp     Disables GMP support

2.  cd bin-devel   OR   cd bin-release

3.  make

    This builds everything

4.  make check  OR  make check-old

    Run regression tests.  
    
    make check:       Requires automake version 1.12 or higher.
    make check-old:   Should always work

5.  make bench

    Run timing tests.  More important for release code.

6.  make install

    (Optional.)  Copies binaries into bin (otherwise they are in src/Apps)

7.  make release
  
    (Very optional.)  Creates canonical executable name with version,
    architecture, and OS.
