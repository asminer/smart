These should all have type void:

Expression print(null) has type: void
Expression print("foo\n") has type: void
Expression cond(true, print("bar\n"), null) has type: void

These should have type int:

Expression 2 has type: int
Expression a has type: int
Expression (2+a) has type: int
Expression (b-a) has type: int
Expression (a*b) has type: int

These should have type real:

Expression 5.1 has type: real
Expression (5.1+real(a)) has type: real
Expression (real(b)+c) has type: real
Expression (real(b)-c) has type: real
Expression (real(b)*c) has type: real
Expression (real(b)/c) has type: real
Expression (a/b) has type: real

Aggregate types:

Expression a:b:c has type: int:int:real
Expression 3:4:null has type: int:int:null

Testing function promotions:

Should be int:
Expression myfunc(3) has type: int
Should be rand int:
Expression myfunc(R) has type: rand int
Should be real:
Expression myfunc(3.5) has type: real
Should be rand real:
Expression myfunc(X) has type: rand real
Definitely real:
Expression myfunc(X) has type: real
Depends on promotion distances, currently real:
Expression myfunc(rand real(R)) has type: real

Testing max() function promotions

Should be int:
Expression max(3, 4, 5) has type: int
Should be real:
Expression max(real(3), 4.1, 5) has type: real
Should be ph int:
Expression max(3, 4, equilikely(5, 6)) has type: ph int
Should be ph real:
Expression max(real(0), ph real(expo(5))) has type: ph real
Should be ph real:
Expression max(erlang(3, 4), ph real(expo(5))) has type: ph real
Should be rand int:
Expression max(3, bernoulli(0.5), R) has type: rand int
Should be rand real:
Expression max(erlang(3, 4), rand real(expo(5)), X) has type: rand real

Testing ord() promotions

Should be int:
Expression ord(2, 1, 3, 5) has type: int
Should be real:
Expression ord(2, 1.1, 3.3, 5.5) has type: real
Should be ph int:
Expression ord(2, equilikely(1, 5), 3, 4) has type: ph int
Should be ph real:
Expression ord(2, erlang(1, 1), erlang(2, 2), erlang(3, 3)) has type: ph real
Should be rand int:
Expression ord(equilikely(1, 3), 2, 4, 6) has type: rand int
Expression ord(equilikely(1, 3), 2, 4, R) has type: rand int
Should be rand real:
Expression ord(equilikely(1, 3), 2.1, 4.2, 6.3) has type: rand real
Expression ord(equilikely(1, 3), real(2), real(4), X) has type: rand real

The end
