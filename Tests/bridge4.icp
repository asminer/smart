/*
	Bridge crossing optimization problem, it goes something like this.
	There are 4 people that must cross an old bridge at night,
	and only 1 flashlight.  2 people can cross the bridge at a time.
	Each person walks at a different speed.  What is the fastest
	we can get everyone across the bridge?

	People start on the left side and go to the right side.

	We identify people by their speeds, so the speeds
	need to be unique.
