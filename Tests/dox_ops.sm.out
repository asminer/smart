Help topic: trinary .. ..
    Operator .. .. is used for intervals (within {}). It may be used on 
    the following types of expressions:
    int .. int .. int                      has type {int}
    int .. int .. real                     has type {real}
    int .. real .. int                     has type {real}
    int .. real .. real                    has type {real}
    real .. int .. int                     has type {real}
    real .. int .. real                    has type {real}
    real .. real .. int                    has type {real}
    real .. real .. real                   has type {real}
