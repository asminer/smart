title: "SMART: Stochastic Model-checking Analyzer for Reliability and Timing"
---


Welcome to the new home for SMART,
a software package to study complex discrete-state systems.
Models may be specified either directly, as a finite state machine
or Markov chain,
or using a high-level formalism, such as a Petri net.
Analysis engines include CTL model checking and computation of
performance measures.
