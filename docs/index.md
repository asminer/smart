# SMART: Stochastic Model-checking Analyzer for Reliability and Timing

Welcome to the new home for SMART,
a software package to study complex discrete-state systems.
Models may be specified either directly, as a finite state machine
or Markov chain,
or using a high-level formalism, such as a Petri net.
Analysis engines include CTL model checking and computation of
performance measures.

Note that this site is currently under construction,
as one of the co-designers of SMART has recently moved from
UCR to ISU.
In the coming months, we hope to have a nicer site for SMART,
and we are currently working to merge the various forks of SMART
into a single, unified version.
