## Running SMART

SMART reads input written in the SMART language,
which is similar to C and C++ but with several significant differences.
You can run SMART from the command line without any arguments
to display the version and other information:
```bash
smart
```
(assuming ```smart``` is in your ```PATH```).
Ordinarily, though, you would run ```smart``` with one or more
arguments, which are input files in the SMART language,
read in order.
